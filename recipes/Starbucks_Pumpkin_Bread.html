    <h1 class="title">Starbucks Pumpkin Bread</h1>
    <img class="mainimg" src="../img/PumpBr.jpg">
    <h2 class="subtext">Description:</h2>
    <p class="inglist">This copycat Starbucks pumpkin bread recipe is delicious. A thick slice of moist Starbucks pumpkin bread is the perfect companion for your morning cup of joe! Many other pumpkin bread recipes produce sad, squat loaves, but not this clone. Here's a custom formula that makes enough batter to fill a medium loaf pan. And when the bread is done, you'll slice the beefy loaf into eight thick slices of goodness that perfectly mimic the weight, color, and flavor of the real thing.</p>
    <h2 class="subtext">Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul class="inglist">
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup light brown sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>¾ cup canned pumpkin</li>
        <li>¾ cup vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="subtext">Steps:</h2>
    <ol class="inglist">
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8 1/2-x4 1/2-inch loaf pan.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, baking soda, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl; mix well and set aside.</li> 
        <li>Beat eggs, white sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract in a large bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until combined, about 30 seconds. Beat in pumpkin and oil. Add flour mixture; mix until batter is blended and smooth. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.</li> 
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the top is dark brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean, about 70 minutes.</li> 
        <li>Let bread cool in the pan for about 30 minutes, then invert onto a wire rack to cool completely. Cut into 1-inch-thick slices.</li>
    </ol>
